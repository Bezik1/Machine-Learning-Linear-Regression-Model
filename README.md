The problem I faced with was about getting besty value for \
our x input value. To achieve that I used basic statistic formula:
* linear function equation `yᵢ = axᵢ + b`
* slope equation `b = (n*Σxᵢyᵢ - Σxᵢ * Σyᵢx) / (n*Σxᵢ**2 - (Σxᵢ)**2)`
* arithmetic average of varaible y `y = Σyᵢ / n`
* arithmetic average of varaible x `x = Σxᵢ / n`
